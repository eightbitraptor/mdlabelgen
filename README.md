# MDLabelGen

A program to generate MiniDisc Labels from the command line or a toml configuration.

Currently targeted towards 2x3 inch Zink sticker prints.

Very much alpha quality software

## TODO

- Support for Japanese fonts
- Support for A4 label sheets/more sizes than Zink
- Automatic word wrapping of title/artist
